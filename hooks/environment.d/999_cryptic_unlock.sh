## A foundational concept for the usage of this hook is that we can deny access to secrets
## (such as the agent private key or the build token file) by deleting or unmounting the
## `/secrets` folder.  This agent should always be running within some kind of sandbox,
## whether that be a Docker container or whatever.  When the job is finished, the buildkite
## agent should exit, causing the docker container to restart and restore the deleted files.
## This gives us the capability to deny access to these files to later steps within the
## current buildkite job.
SECRETS_MOUNT_POINT="/secrets"

## The secrets that must be contained within:
##    - `agent.{key,pub}`: An RSA private/public keypair (typically generated via the
##       script `bin/create_agent_keypair`).  See the top-level `README.md` for more.
##    - `buildkite-api-token`: A buildkite API token (with `read_builds` permission).
